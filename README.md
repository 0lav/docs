# Helium Documentation

Documentation for the Helium network.

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version >= 10.15.1 or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed  

* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running yarn version). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the npm client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

### Installation
```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Contributing

Documentation is managed by Helium, but supported by the community. 

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more instructions.
