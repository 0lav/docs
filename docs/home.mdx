### Welcome to the Helium Network

The Helium Network is the largest, public LPWAN in the United States, and enables long range, low power, bi-directional communication for any LoRaWAN compatible device. 

The Helium Network is open and permissionless, and requires no up-front payments, contracts or commitments to use. Devices pay Helium Hotspot owners and other Helium Network Operators on a per-packet basis for delivering their sensors packets to the application end point. 

In this documentation you will find examples, tutorials, specifications, and API references for building on the Helium network.
