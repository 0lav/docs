### Welcome to the Helium Network

The Helium Network is the largest, public LPWAN in the United States, and enables long range, low power, bi-directional communication for any LoRaWAN compatible device. 

The Helium Network is open and permissionless, and requires no up-front payments, contracts or commitments to use. Devices pay Helium Hotspot owners and other Helium Network Operators on a per-packet basis for delivering their sensors packets to the application end point. 

In this documentation you will find examples, tutorials, specifications, and API references for building on the Helium network.

## Console

Console is Helium's web-based interface for deploying and managing devices; and building flexible application-level logic into your IoT deployments.

##  Devices

At its core, the Helium Network exists to route data for LoRaWAN-enabled devices. Whether you're building a weather station from scratch or have a pre-built location tracker from a vendor of your choosing, we're ready for you.

##  Miners

A Helium miner is a combination LoRaWAN router and Helium blockchain miner. There are thousands deployed across the world.

##  Blockchain

The Helium blockchain is what sets the Helium Network apart from other network providers. For developers, it means you can take advantage of one, unified feature set wherever Helium coverage exists. No roaming or brokering of packets required. Send data and the Network takes care of the rest. 

## Routers

Routers are cloud-based participants in the Helium Network and are the termination point for device data. Routers are identifiable by their OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and are operated by developers and enterprises deploying sensor applications on the Helium Network. Helium also operates a high-availability router thatâ€™s open to Helium Network users.
